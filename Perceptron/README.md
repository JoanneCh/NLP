# Perceptron Classifiers (Vanilla & Averaged)

### Overview
Use perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either true or fake, and either positive or negative. 

The perceplearn3.py will learn perceptron models (vanilla and averaged) from the training data, and the percepclassify3.py will use the models to classify new data. 

### Data
* per line (total 96002lines). The first 302tokens in each line are:
    1. a unique 7-character alphanumeric identifier
    2. a label True or Fake
    3. a label Pos or Neg
* These are followed by the text of the review.
* One file dev-text.txt with unlabeled development data, containing just the unique identifier followed by the text of the review (total 32002lines).
* One file dev-key.txt with the corresponding labels for the development data, to serve as an answer key.
